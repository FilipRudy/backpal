
## Why is this folder here?

This project utilizes AWS Lambda functionalities, and I wanted to showcase an example function used to test a user's result from one of the lessons. Normally, these functions are not included in the repository, but I believe showcasing this is a key part of the project.

There are no installation instructions for this repository since it is designed to be managed through AWS services.
